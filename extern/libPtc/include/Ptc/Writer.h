/**
 * @class Writer
 * @brief Write a PTC 2 sequence file to disk.
 *
 * @author Johannes Meng <johannes.meng@student.kit.edu>
 * @date   October 2009
 *
 * The format PTC 2 consists of headers and data blocks. Each header
 * contains some numerical information, all of which are saved as
 * 4-byte unsigned integers in little endian format. 
 *
 * The PTC2 format, in Extended Backus-Naur Form, is given below. The 
 * symbol @a UINT32 signifies a 32 bit unsigned integer,
 * @a CHAR all bytes except 0x00, and @a NULL the null-byte 0x00.\n
 *
 * @code
 * FILE = FILEHEADER {FRAME};
 *
 * FILEHEADER = "P" "T" "C" "2" "S" FRAMECOUNT SIZE {META};
 * META = NAME VALUECOUNT VALUEWIDTH DATA;
 *
 * FRAME = FRAMEHEADER DATA;
 * FRAMEHEADER = NEXTOFFSET BLOCKCOUNT {BLOCKHEADER};
 * BLOCKHEADER = NAME BLOCKOFFSET VALUECOUNT VALUEWIDTH;
 *
 * DATA = {CHAR | NULL};
 * NAME = {CHAR} NULL;
 * BLOCKCOUNT = UINT32;
 * BLOCKOFFSET = UINT32;
 * FRAMECOUNT = UINT32;
 * NEXTOFFSET = UINT32;
 * SIZE = UINT32;
 * VALUECOUNT = UINT32;
 * VALUEWIDTH = UINT32;
 * @endcode
 *
 * @a SIZE in @a @a FILEHEADER is the size the amount of meta blocks.\n
 * @a NEXTOFFSET is the offset, in bytes, of the next frame relative to 
 * the current one. If this is 0, the current frame is the last one.\n
 * @a BLOCKOFFSET is the offset of the block described by the current header,
 * in bytes, relative to the first byte in this frame.\n\n
 * The @a DATA block in @a FRAME consists of sub-blocks, one per @a BLOCKHEADER.
 * Each must be @a VALUECOUNT * @a VALUEWIDTH bytes in size (with the values
 * taken from the corresponding @a BLOCKHEADER).\n
 * @a FRAMECOUNT must be equal to the actual count of frames contained in the
 * file.\n
 * All @a NAMEs must be unique in their respective scope: Metadata names
 * must be unique between all metadata, and block names must be 
 * unique within a single frame.
